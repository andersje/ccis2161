<H1><A name=sed_name_0>NAME</A> </H1>sed-tutorial - a small tutorial about sed 
<P>
<P>
<HR>

<H1><A name=sed_description_0>DESCRIPTION</A> </H1>sed(1) is a non-interactive 
text editor that comes with UNIX since Version 7 AT&amp;T UNIX. It's main 
purpose is to be used in scripts. 
<P>
<P>
<HR>

<H1><A name=sed_simple_0>SIMPLE TEXT EDITING</A> </H1>sed(1) works as a filter, 
which makes it particularly useful for scripts. sed(1) works line oriented. The 
most simple commands are a pattern and an action. If no pattern is given, the 
action is applied to all lines, otherwise it is applied only to lines matching 
the pattern. 
<P>
<H2><A name=sed_line_oriented_0>Line-oriented Patterns</A> </H2>A sample 
application of sed(1) would be to delete the first 10 lines of stdin and echo 
the rest to stdout: 
<P><XMP>  sed -e '1,10d'

</XMP>
<P>The <CODE>-e</CODE> tells sed to <STRONG>execute</STRONG> the next command 
line argument as sed program. Since sed programs often contain regular 
expressions, they will often contain characters that your shell interprets, so 
you should get used to put all sed programs in single quotes so your shell won't 
interpret the sed program. In this case, nothing bad would have happened, but 
since almost all other examples will contain meta-characters, you really should 
get used to quoting your programs. This simple sed program contains a pattern 
(``1,10'') and an action (``d''). What sed(1) does is apply all actions whose 
pattern match and finally print the line unless the action was ``d''. If you 
don't want sed(1) to print each line by default, you can give sed the 
<CODE>-n</CODE> option. Then only lines that you print explicitly (with the 
``p'' action) appear on stdout. 
<P>If we wanted to print only the first ten lines, we would have deleted all the 
lines starting with 11: 
<P><XMP>  sed -e '11,$d'

</XMP>
<P>Note that <CODE>$</CODE> is the last line. Because sed(1) processes the input 
line by line, it does not keep the whole input in memory. This makes sed(1) very 
useful for processing large files, but it has it's drawbacks, too. For example, 
we can't use <CODE>sed -e '<STRONG>$-</STRONG>10,<STRONG>$d</STRONG>'</CODE>, 
since sed doesn't know <CODE>$</CODE> before the end of file, so it doesn't know 
where <CODE><STRONG>$-</STRONG>10</CODE> is. This is a major problem, and it 
limits sed(1)'s usefulness, but sed(1) still has a large number of appliances. 
<P>Another way to get only the first 10 lines is to use the <CODE>-n</CODE> 
option: 
<P><XMP>  sed -n -e '1,10p'

</XMP>
<P>If we want to delete only one line, the pattern can be <CODE>'10,10'</CODE> 
or simple <CODE>'10'</CODE>. 
<P>
<H2><A name=sed_more_0>More Than One Command</A> </H2>Commands in sed(1) 
programs are separated by new lines. So if we wanted to delete the lines 1 to 4 
and 6 to 9, we could use: 
<P><XMP>  sed -e '1,4d
6,9d'

</XMP>
<P>Another possibility is to use the <CODE>-e</CODE> option more than once: 
<P><XMP>  sed -e '1,4d' -e '6,9d'

</XMP>
<P>That's why we used the <CODE>-e</CODE> option all the time. In fact, you can 
omit it if you have only one command in your program. But you should get used to 
the <CODE>-e</CODE> option, so you won't have to add it if you want to extend 
your program later on. 
<P>
<H2><A name=sed_regular_0>Regular Expression Oriented Patterns</A> </H2>Often, 
we don't know the numbers of the lines we want to delete. A good example is a 
log file. Log files tend to grow until they become too large to handle. Let's 
assume that you have a large log file called <CODE>log</CODE> which contains 
thousands of lines. Now you want to delete all the lines that contain the word 
``debug'': 
<P><XMP>  sed -e '/debug/d' < log

</XMP>
<P>This works just like <CODE>grep -v debug</CODE>. 
<P>
<H2><A name=sed_a_0>A Slightly More Complex Example</A> </H2>We are still 
working with the large log file. Now we not only want to delete lines with the 
word debug, but we only want lines that contain ``foo''. The traditional way to 
handle this would be: 
<P><XMP>  grep 'foo' < log | grep -v debug

</XMP>
<P>Note that this spawns two grep processes. The sed equivalent would be: 
<P><XMP>  sed -n -e '/debug/d' -e '/foo/p'

</XMP>
<P>You might wonder why lines with debug aren't printed if they contain foo. The 
answer is that the ``d'' action skips the rest of the patterns and actions, too, 
it does not just inhibit the print in the end (which is inhibited here due to 
the <CODE>-n</CODE>, anyway). 
<P>
<H2><A name=sed_putting_0>Putting sed Programs Into Files</A> </H2>Now that your 
programs are getting a little more advanced, you might want to put them in 
script files instead of using the command line. To tell sed(1) about your 
program file, you use the <CODE>-f</CODE> option: 
<P><XMP>  sed -f program.sed

</XMP>
<P>There is a kludge in sed(1) that allows you to set the <CODE>-n</CODE> option 
from within your sed program if you use ``#n'' as the <STRONG>first</STRONG> 
line in your program file. From now on I will assume that you run the examples 
through <CODE>sed -f</CODE>. 
<P>
<H2><A name=sed_inserting_0>Inserting Text</A> </H2>You can insert text with the 
``a'' and ``i'' actions. The syntax is: 
<P><XMP>  10i\
  string to be inserted

</XMP>
<P>The difference between ``i'' and ``a'' is that ``i'' inserts before the 
current line and ``a'' appends after the current line. So ``1i'' will insert 
before the first line and ``<STRONG>$a</STRONG>'' will append after the last 
line. 
<P>
<H2><A name=sed_replacing_0>Replacing the current line</A> </H2>You can replace 
the current line with the ``c'' action. The syntax is like ``i'' and ``a'': 
<P><XMP>  10c\
  new contents for line 10

</XMP>
<P>
<H2><A name=sed_printing_0>Printing The Current Line Visually Unambiguously</A> 
</H2>The ``l'' action is <STRONG>very</STRONG> useful when editing files with 
nonprintable characters. It prints the current line visually unambiguously. For 
example, long lines are broken, but the lines end with a \ to show that they 
were broken. Normal backslashes in the text are escaped, too, tabs are replaced 
with <CODE>\t</CODE> and nonprintable characters are printed as escaped 
three-digit octal numbers. This example is quite useful as shell alias: 
<P><XMP>  sed -n -e 'l'

</XMP>
<P>
<H2><A name=sed_aborting_0>Aborting Processing</A> </H2>The ``q'' action 
branches to the end of the script and ends the script processing after this 
line. So, yet another way of printing the first 10 lines would have been: 
<P><XMP>  sed -e '10q'

</XMP>
<P>
<P>
<HR>

<H1><A name=sed_regular_1>REGULAR EXPRESSION SUBSTITUTION</A> </H1>The 
``s/<EM>pattern</EM>/<EM>replacement</EM>/[flags]'' action is the most often 
used sed(1) action. In fact, most sed programs consist only of substitute 
commands, since this is so immensely useful. The regular expression 
<EM>pattern</EM> is substituted by the replacement string (which can contain 
several special symbols). The most basic substitution would be 
<P><XMP>  sed -e 's/foo/bar/'

</XMP>
<P>which would just change the string ``foo'' to ``bar''.
